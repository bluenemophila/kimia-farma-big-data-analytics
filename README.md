# 📌 1. Project Background
Kimia Farma is a major pharmaceutical company in Indonesia with an extensive network of clinics and pharmacies. As part of a virtual internship in Big Data Analysis, I was tasked with developing a business intelligence dashboard to provide actionable sales insights. The primary goal was to support decision-making by visualizing key performance metrics across time, products, and branches.

# 📊 2. Objective
The main objective of this project was to analyze sales data from January to June 2022 to uncover revenue trends, top products, and customer behavior. The dashboard was designed to help the management monitor business performance in real time. It also aimed to provide comparisons between product sales, branch performance, and customer segments.

# ⚙️ 3. Tools & Technologies Used
I used Microsoft Power BI to build the interactive dashboards, leveraging DAX for calculated fields and measures. The data was provided in spreadsheet format, and I performed cleaning, transformation, and modeling within Power BI. Additional visualization features like slicers, maps, and drill-through pages were used to enhance user experience.

# 📈 4. Data Analysis Process
The data was first cleaned to ensure accuracy, removing any duplicates and standardizing product and branch names. I then created various visualizations such as line charts for daily trends, bar charts for top-selling products, and pie charts for sales distribution by branch. Relationships between tables were defined to allow dynamic filtering across all visuals.

# 📍 5. Business Impact
With this dashboard, decision-makers at Kimia Farma can quickly identify high-performing products and branches. It allows them to focus marketing or inventory strategies on specific regions or customer segments. The report also enables real-time tracking of revenue and customer engagement over time.

# 🎓 6. Lessons Learned
Through this project, I strengthened my data visualization and dashboard design skills using Power BI. I learned how to turn raw transactional data into meaningful insights that can support business strategy. The experience also taught me how to present data in a clear and interactive format for non-technical stakeholders.
